###  :girl: A little bit about me 

Hi! My name is **Anvitha Nallan** and I am an **aspiring UI/UX Designer** with a passion for creating aesthetic and interactive user experiences. I like to consider myself a very creative individual, and I constantly keep myself busy, be it through *painting*, or by *baking* a delicious cake. I also love *basketball* and *dance*. Occasionally, I also dabble in some *video editing*.

### :books: What I'm currently working on 

While I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at BITS Pilani, I found my interest in the field of **Human Centered Design**, and have taken up several courses outside of college to hone my skills in the field. I have completed a **Specialisation in UI/UX Design** offered by CalArts on Coursera, where I designed 3 different apps/desktop - mobile websites as a part of the course. Through the process, I have become proficient in quiet a few wireframing and prototyping tools: *Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Balsamiq,* to name a few. I plan to pick up some ***freelance projects*** in designing apps/websites to further work on my skills.
